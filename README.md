# lendTrack
An android app which helps us to track money that we've lent to people and keep a track record
of the amount that they have paid back to us or that we have given more to them.
This app is an alternative to book keeping, complete with transaction history
and fingerprint authentication to secure the changes so that no one other than us should have access to the records.
